# Orders Data Analysis with Python and SQL

This project explores, analyzes, and derives insights from an orders dataset. It utilizes Python (Pandas) for data manipulation and cleaning, the Kaggle API for data acquisition, and SQL Server for data storage and querying.

## Project Goals

- Understand the structure and features of the orders dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
- Load the cleaned data into a SQL Server database.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries.
- Answer insightful questions about the orders data.
- Gain hands-on experience with data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and Python-SQL integration.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Download the orders dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning (Python - Pandas)**
   - Analyze data structure, features, and missing values.
   - Investigate key statistics and identify data patterns.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Standardize data formats for improved analysis.

3. **Data Loading into SQL Server**
   - Establish a connection to a SQL Server database using Python libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, pyodbc).
   - Transform the cleaned dataset into a SQL-compatible format.
   - Load the transformed data into the SQL Server database.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL**
   - Formulate SQL queries to analyze trends and patterns in the loaded dataset.
   - Extract insights on sales trends, customer segmentation, product performance, etc.
   - Visualize findings using SQL-based visualization tools or integrate with external libraries.

5. **Answering Questions with SQL**
   - Pose and answer insightful questions about the orders data using SQL.
   - Explore aspects like sales trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.

6. **Conclusion and Insights**
   - Summarize the key findings and insights derived from the data analysis.
   - Discuss the significance of the results in the context of your goals.
   - Outline potential implications and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
